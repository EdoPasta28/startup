			<h2>The situation today!</h1>
			<p>
				Bees are dying at an unsustainable rate, wreaking havoc on our natural environment. They are important pollinators, and their extinction would have a disastrous impact on all ecosystems. That's why we're striving to increase bee habitat and eliminate the use of insecticides that kill bees.
			</p>

	<div class="container">
		<h2>What can we DO?</h1>
			<p>
				Bee-killing insecticides, the loss of excellent habitat, disease, and our changing climate are all blamed by scientists for bee deaths. While we work to address each of these issues, there are three things we can do now to help save the bees: plant more pollinator-friendly plants, stop using bee-killing pesticides in parks, wildlife refuges, and other areas where bees should be safe, and promote sustainable, pesticide-free agricultural practices.
